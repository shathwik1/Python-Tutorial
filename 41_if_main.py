# if __name__ = '__main__': (this script can be imported OR run standalone)
#                         Functions and classes in this module can be reused
#                         without the main black of code executing

# Good practice (code is modular,
#                helps readability,
#                leaves no global variables,
#                avoid unintended execution)

#                         Ex. library = import library for functionality
#                         When running library directly, display a help page

def main():
    # Your program goes here
    pass


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
